A complete clinical history or patient story may include varying level of details about multiple episodes of an identified symptom or reported sign, as well as multiple symptoms/signs.\r\n\r\nThis archetype has been designed to record the positive presence of the symptom or sign as part of history taking using OBSERVATION.story, or in conjunction with a positive response to OBSERVATION.symptom_sign_screening.\r\n\r\nIn the purest sense, symptoms are subjective observations of a physical or mental disturbance and signs are objective observations of the same, as experienced by an individual and reported to the history taker by the same individual or another party. From this logic it follows that we will need two archetypes to record clinical history - one for reported symptoms and another for reported signs. In reality this is impractical as it will require clinical data entry into either one of these models which adds signficant overheads to modellers and those entering data. In addition, there is often overlap in clinical concepts - for example, is previous vomiting or bleeding to be categorised as a symptom or reported sign? In response, this archetype has been specifically designed to proved a single information model that allows for recording of the entire continuum between clearly identifable symptoms and reported signs when recording a clinical history.\r\n\r\nThis archetype has been intended to be used as a generic pattern for all symptoms and reported signs. The 'Specific details' SLOT can be used to extend the archetype to include additional, specific data elements for more complex symptoms or signs. \r\n\r\nThis archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Structured detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.story archetype, but can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes and in the 'Associated symptom/sign' or 'Previous episode' SLOT within other instances of this CLUSTER.symptom_sign archetype.
